Super stoked to see all of you and excited to welcome you to this
interactive demo of **presence**. This room is a simulated web
application. You are all potential users of the site, this foreword is a
landing page and to see the rest of the presentation you'll need to
authenticate. As you may have noticed this site is not HTTPS nor do I
have a privacy policy :)

I'm CJ Avilla, I work at App Academy and I would love it if you would
all stand up, please.

Repeat after me:

my username is: <state your username>
PAUSE
my password id: <state your password>

click submit, and take a seat.

Welcome back username!

Our application has included a feature to show who's currently online.
You may imagine that this application is a collaborative document
editor, maybe a game, but most likely its a Chat room. Given that many
of you are here to, as they say, "meet up" with one another.

Lets quickly explore 4 alternatives to showing who's online.

Lets first get a quick lay of the land.

Number 1! Using some sort of last seen date.

Code!
